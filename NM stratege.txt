Typically beaten by having a Scholar repeatedly do a Gravitation
 Skillchain so Black Mage can burst Death and Comet.

Another good option is to instead have a Scholar do Distortion and have a Corsair with an extremely
 good Leaden Salute set fire off Leaden Salute to create a [[Darkness] skillchain. Not only will Leaden Salute hit very
 hard but so will the resulting skillchain. Black Mages can burst Death off that skillchain, 
essentially giving you three heavy hits in one

NM TP move can Dispel. Seems to resist physical damage.
Weak to Thunder magic damage.
When below 50%, will use 2 TP moves back-to-back.
Will use Mighty Strike / Invincible / Elemental Sforzo / other? once at 75% HP. 
Will give a random global geo debuff for the rest of the fight (attack down / defends down / magic attack down / magic defends down / accuracy down / magic accuracy down etc) to the party.
Will summon 1 add when it use SP. 
About 1.9 million HP? Gain Regen if add is alive. Regen is about 2500HP / tick?
Add have about same HP as boss?
Add put everyone that has enmity on boss to its hatelist?
Need to keep doing action on add to keep hate?
Add can be Sleep, but require Immunobreak.
Add can be Bind Gravity.
Add resist Troubadour Lullaby?

Plan: 
SC: RUN Freezebit + SCH Water = Fragmentation + COR Last Stand = Light
COR save Random Deal and Wild Card, to reset SCH's Stratagems and RUN's Rayke.
SCH MB Helix2 on first SC, try to keep 10k+ Helix2 damage up at all time.
Ideally push to 75% before SCH need to use Tabula Rasa. When SCH use Tabula Rasa, SCH solo SC.
BLM Mana Wall when NM about to reach 75%, as the add will most likely go to BLM.
When add pop, RDM grab add with Bind / Gravity / Stymie Sleep2, and RUN move the NM to another spot (so the Bound add won't hit whoever's closest). RDM keep add away from the Party.
GEO: Geo-Malaise / Indi-INT / Entrust Indi-Acumen. Bolster around 40%. Burst during windows

After reviewing, our initial position on the bridge was bad, mage should have stayed on the North side of the bridge, more space to maneuver when add pop, instead of the bottleneck on the bridge.

Weak to blunt. 
When below 50%, will use 2 TP moves back-to-back.
Will use Mighty Strike / Invincible / Elemental Sforzo / other? once at 75% HP and 40% HP.
Boss will then give a random global geo debuff for the rest of the fight (attack down / defends down / magic attack down / magic defends down / accuracy down / magic accuracy down etc) to the party. When Boss use 2nd SP, a new global geo debuff will be chosen randomly.
Will summon 1 pet each time Boss use SP, can have up to 2 pets.
Boss gain Regen if pet alive.
1 pet alive, Boss Regen about 2.5k-3.5k HP/tick?
2 pets alive, Boss Regen about 6.5k HP/tick?
Killing the pets will remove the Boss's Regen.
Boss has about 2.3 million HP? 
Pet probably have over 1million HP?
Pet put everyone that has enmity on Boss to its hatelist?
Need to keep doing action on pet to keep hate?
Pet will ignore the person the Boss is targeting, unless only 1 person left.
Can Bind / Gravity / Sleep pets. Easier to Bind Gravity than Sleep.
Boss has WS wall (if keep using same WS, the damage will drop), need to alternate WS.

Plan: 
In Lobby area: Tactic Roll and GEO Entrust as needed.
RDM Saboteur Gravity2 on Boss, Tank build hate then kite boss.
DD chase and attack Boss.
RDM Bind / Gravity / Sleep pets when they pop.
Save Random Deal / Wildcard to reset Warcry / Impetus / SP, preferably during the last 40%.
If someone got Dispelled, rebuff them fast. Priority on Dirge / Sirvente.

---------------

sortie nm BF/DH

Optional objectives:
I didn't include objectives such as resting/Devices because they are so quick to do and not really time consuming that you can just run there and do them instantly and on the way to the next area. We do them all except keys. We rest, buff spell, hurray, kill mob at C device and drop entry item.

Melee Sortie :

Mostly none.  We are choosing Weaponskills that can incidentally SC but are just zerging.
  Aita/Degai in particular, we actively try to avoid SCs.
Aita/Degai: Torcleaver/Upheaval/Savage Blade/Black Halo.  We try to avoid SCs because sometimes we heal him 
:x
Skomora/Triboulex: Torcleaver/Upheaval/Savage Blade Black Halo (I try to SC off my own Torcleavers and the SBs and Black Halos for nice damage) but we don't really hold for SCs because of his annoying TP reset.

Leshonn:  No SCs at all.  Everybody, including DRK, switch to Savage Blade

Gartell:  I use Cross Reaper and Quietus while WAR uses Impulse Drive.  WAR is going to spam Impulse during Mighty Strikes because he'll hit all 9s.  I try to SC where I can but try to get out as many Weaponskills as possible.  This is especially true when he is starts with Wind Hand; I just spam Cross Reaper.  Quietus is only used if I have an opportunity to close a 3-step which is rare.  What's nice though is Impulse - Cross Reaper - Quietus and Cross Reaper - Impulse - Quietus both work.  BRD uses Rudra Storm and actively holds TP to close SCs when he can (Rudras can also close the 3-step).  When he is Thunder Hand his stuns make it hard to SC so we just do our best.

Ghatjot/Dhartok:  I switch to Insurgency.  This fight you absolutely can do massive SCs off of SB/Black Halo and it leads to all 9s Lights and this fight doesn't have any annoying mechanics to interrupt SCs so we try to do them on this guy.

E and G you can simply do 
Seraph(RDM) > Hot shot(COR) > Flat(RDM) > Savage(COR) > Dimidation(RUN). 
You dont even need SCH to make SC.
---------------------
For F you can do
