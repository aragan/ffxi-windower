Linkshell shout

MORRIA-Linkshell End-Game events, help, #discord #fun Do you need it? PST primetime, lots of activity /t.



??  ** LINKSHELL** ??

??  **Linkshell Primetime**??
   3~8 PST / 6~11 EST

Welcome to **MORRIA**, we are here to help each other acquire friendship and power in Final Fantasy XI. 
We are focused on end-game, but anyone with the spirit of growth is most welcome.

? ? **Modus Operandi** ? ? 

**1**. Gear is a matter of time, everything can be obtained if one is willing to learn.  
 
?? Our greatest members could have logged in for the first time today, so we must help them grow.

**2**. **How** one does things is just as important, if not more than **what** you do. 

?? As such, we do not employ **blatant exploits**, nor the following behaviors as a Linkshell:

?? Glitching mobs to where they can't attack. 
??Cupper/clipper/JA0/POSHacking/Anchor Tools.
??Duping etc.
??If you need to think about it, or if you couldn't use it while under public view, you probably shouldn't be using it. **I.E. Common sense applies.**


?? This is to protect the investment that people have put into their characters and the shell overall. It is a shame when gear leaves the shell, even worse when the hard work is "deleted".

**3**. As citizens of Asura we should strive to improve the overall health and culture of the Server via helping others, sharing knowledge, obtaining strength and striving for mastery.

**4**. Our Linkshell members come first for slotting events / content.  
??Take our members first, teach them, grow them - and we will transcend all notion of limitation.
